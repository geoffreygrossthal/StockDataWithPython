Pandas DataFrame
A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure in Python's Pandas library used for storing and manipulating labeled data in tabular format. It consists of rows and columns, where each column can hold different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings). DataFrames offer powerful tools for data cleaning, analysis, and manipulation, making them essential for data science and analytics tasks.
